# JS Service Calls

* start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'js-service-calls' (`git checkout -b js-service-calls`)
* Add and Modify the files in this directory to have the require features
* Add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and I as reviewers.  
* Due by **Mon Jul 5 11:59pm (ET)**

## Goals and Requirements

You will create a single page application that allows users to
- login
- logout
- while logged in:
  - see their personal stored word
  - change their personal stored word

This is similar to the "express-login" assignment
- Except static HTML files instead of server-generated HTML
- Using client-side JS 
- Using service calls

Key lessons include:
- Making service calls
  - Instead of navigating to new server-based pages
- Sending JSON data in the body
  - Hint: including data
- Performing login/logout with service calls
- Using service status codes
- Parsing and using service data from body

You will be writing:
- **static** html (just one page!)
- **static** css
- client-side JS
  - Using webpack and babel, as with the js-cart assignment

You will not modify any server-side JS files, including server.js

## Different Content Views and Moments

### Page Load

When the page loads, JS code will check for an existing session (the GET /api/session call in Resources)
- If there is a session, JS code will get the existing stored word (the GET /api/word call in Resources) and show the Word View
- If there is not an existing session, JS code will show the Login Page
  - "page" here meaning content, there is only one HTML page, and it is static
- This means that reloading the page 
  - Will NOT forget the stored word
  - Will NOT forget if you are logged in
  - WILL perform this initial page load logic again

### Login

Show a form requesting a username
- When submitted, this form will login (calling, not navigating to, the POST /api/session in Resources)
  - If successful, JS Code will show the Word View
  - If unsuccessful, JS Code will show an appropriate error message to the user ("dog" causes a different error tha username of invalid characters)
    - "dog" simulates the user getting a password wrong
    - Show the user a "nice" error message that is NOT the error message the service returns 
      - but is BASED on the error message the service returns

### Word View

- Show the username
- Show an option to logout 
  - If the user logs out
    - call the logout service (DELETE /api/session in Resources) (call, do not navigate to)
    - Once service call returns, show the user the Login view
- Show a form showing the stored word for this user and offering the option to update it
  - If the user updates the word
    - Call the replace word service (PUT /api/word in Resources) (call, do not navigate to)

### Visuals

The visual requirements are the same as `express-login` - You are welcome to use the same HTML/CSS from that assignment, but:
- Make sure you apply any corrections
  - From that assignment
  - Any discussed in class
  - Any covered by the requirements that may not have been called out on the previous assignment
- Translate the format as needed
  - This assignment is using a base static HTML file + front-end generated HTML, not backend-generated HTML

You must show effort to make it visually attractive and usable
- Make different areas of content visually distinct using colors and/or spacing
- Make content legible using whitespace (padding, margin, line-height, etc)
- Interactions (form fields, buttons, links) must have text/labels to be understood by an uninformed user
- Context (additional text/headings) should make it clear what content is being displayed
- The content should be responsive (text flow to fit) the page at desktop sizes 
  - Avoid fixed sizes on structural elements (those elements that would prevent responsive behavior)
  - Enforced reasonable visual gutters to keep content to a maximum width is allowed but not required

## Resources

This `server.js` offers these urls to use for service calls with the listed HTTP Methods

### GET `/api/session`

Checks to see if the user is logged in 
- If yes, returns JSON of object with `username` property
- If no, returns 401 status 
  - This is not an error to report to user, but an expected flow check

### POST `/api/session`

- Expects body to be JSON of object with a username property

Checks submitted username
- if is "dog", returns 403 status and JSON of object with error property "auth-insufficient"
- if invalid (not alphanumeric or is empty), returns 400 status and JSON of object with error property "required-username"
- if valid, sets the `sid` cookie and returns a JSON of object with username property

### DELETE `/api/session`

Performs a logout, removing the `sid` cookie and deleting any matching session on server

Always returns JSON of object with wasLoggedIn boolean property
- This return value isn't very useful

### GET `/api/word`

Returns JSON of object with username and storedWord properties
- If not logged in, instead returns status 401 and JSON of object with error property of "auth-insufficient"

### PUT `/api/word`

- Expects body to be JSON of object with a "word" property
Returns JSON of object with username and storedWord properties
- If not logged in, instead returns status 401 and JSON of object with error property of "auth-insufficient"

## Restrictions
* You should use the node/npm modules used in class ONLY
* Do not use any outside JS or CSS files or assets
  - Exception: You may use CSS for icons from http://css.gg IF you link to their CSS file on their site
* Use Semantic HTML and semantic CSS class names
* You may not use floats to do more than manage flowing text with images
* You may not use HTML tables or CSS table layouts
* Do not have any outside files in your PR (no files from other assignments, for example)
* Use arrays and objects when they each make sense
* Do not use `var`, use `const` and `let` appropriately
* Do not use `alert`, `prompt` or other blocking JS
* Do not use poor variable and function names
* Do not have functions that are too big/do too much
* Do not have console.log messages from debugging
* Do not have commented out code
