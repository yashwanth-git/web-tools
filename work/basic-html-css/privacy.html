          The website is covers the details of various cats available all around
          the world. The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species:
          it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and
          retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
          sense of smell are well developed. The website will further be
          enhanced to show the power of cats.
