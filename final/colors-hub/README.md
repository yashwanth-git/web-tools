# ColorsHub

* ColorsHub is collection of user created color palettes to share to the world
* The users have to login to view the palettes created by others, save any interesting color palettes, and even create their own palette and share it to the world
* The palettes will have the name of the creator on it (to identify who created the palette)
* The saved palettes will be placed under Saved page
* The user created palettes will be placed under My Colors page and the creator can delete the color palette
* For now, the theme can be changed to night mode manually using the toggle option to the right side of the navbar
